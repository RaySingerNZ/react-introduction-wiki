# JSX

```
git checkout step-1
```

React uses an extended version of JavaScript called JSX. It basically just lets you put html-like markup
into your JavaScript. Where other frameworks bring JavaScipt to HTML React bring HTML to JavaScript.

In this step we have moved  the HTML from the static folder and put it into `src/App.js`. This is a simple process but there are 
a few gotchas with JSX, the main one being `class` has to be `className`.
