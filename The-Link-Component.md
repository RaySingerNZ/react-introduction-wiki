## Using the Link component

```
git checkout step-7
```

The `Link` component is another component from React Router that lets your create a link to a route
like this:

``` javascript

<Link className="btn" to="/locations/1">Read more</Link>

```

This will create an anchor that links to that route. We have now created a link to the single view of the
location. Lets build that in the next step.
